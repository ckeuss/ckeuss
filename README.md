### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Claudia, a former interior architect (M.A.) with several years of work experience in the building sector and now aspiring **data analyst**.
As a data analyst I would like to give space to my structure- and research-loving side and breath life into 'dry' numbers.  
I would like to use data to optimize decision-making processes and shed light on user experiences.

Due to my domain knowledge I can imagine to eventually merge both worlds - the built environment and data analytics.
However, I am also interested in sociology, sustainability, psychology and user experience in other realms.
Since I am a design enthusiast I do value the visual and communicative aspect of data too and aim to dive deeper into 
data viz topics (fan of Alberto Cairo and Edward Tufte!).

At the moment I am focusing on learning the technical side of data analytics.  
I have recently finished an 9-month training with courses in  
R | Python |  SQL | Data Science | Power BI | Tableau
- EDA, data manipulation and visualization using R and Python
- data querying and data modeling using SQL
- regression analysis, hypothesis testing and predictive modeling
- creating dashboards using Power BI and Tableau
